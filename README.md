# üß† AI-Powered Applications: RAG, Agents, Multimodal & Automation Projects
This repository showcases a collection of advanced AI projects focused on real-world applications of LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), agentic workflows, OCR, multimodal search, and audio processing. From intelligent document Q&A systems to personalized job recommenders and meeting summarizers, each project demonstrates the integration of cutting-edge AI tools like OpenAI, LangChain, Whisper, LayoutLM, and vector databases to solve complex tasks across text, audio, and image modalities.

------

**1. RAG-Based Domain-Specific Q&A System**
- A chatbot powered by LLM + vector database that answers questions from custom documents like legal contracts or company policies using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

**2. Agentic AI Workflow Assistant (Multi-Step Planner)**
- An LLM-driven agent that automates multi-step tasks (e.g., booking flights, hotels, and blocking calendars) using API calls and tools like LangGraph or AutoGen.

**3. Multimodal RAG for Image + Text Search**
- Search across both images and text in slides or PDFs (e.g., YouTube presentations) with questions like ‚ÄúWhere does person X talk about success?‚Äù using multimodal RAG.

**4. AI Research Assistant for Papers & PDFs**
- Upload academic papers and ask research-specific questions like ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the main contribution?‚Äù or ‚ÄúSummarize Section 3.1‚Äù using LLM + document parsing.

**5. Meeting Extractor (Audio ‚Üí Text ‚Üí LLM Insights)**
- Transcribes meetings, extracts action items and decisions, and generates follow-up emails from audio files using Whisper and LLMs.

**6. Invoice or Document Parsing Using OCR + Transformers**
- Extract structured data (like names, dates, totals) from scanned or messy PDFs using OCR (Tesseract) and document layout models like LayoutLM or Donut.

**7. AI-Powered Job or Course Recommender System**
- Recommends personalized jobs or courses by scraping listings, embedding skill requirements, and matching them with user profiles using semantic search.

**8. Voice-to-Text App with Speaker Separation**
- A speech-to-text app that transcribes audio and separates speakers using Whisper and speaker diarization models like PyAnnote or NVIDIA NeMo.

**9. Policy Navigator: AI for Legal & Government Docs**
- Lets users ask questions about local laws or public policies, powered by LLM + vector search from scraped government/legal documents.

**10. Multimodal Personal Knowledge Base Agent**
- Upload notes, PDFs, images, code snippets, and ask personalized queries like ‚ÄúWhat was the score of my last model?‚Äù using multimodal LLM + vector search.
